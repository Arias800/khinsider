#khinsider.py
`khinsider.py` is a [Python](https://www.python.org/) interface for getting [khinsider](http://downloads.khinsider.com/) soundtracks. It makes khinsider mass downloads a breeze. It's easy to use - check it!

From command line:
```
khinsider.py jumping-flash
```

As an import:
```python
import khinsider
khinsider.download('jumping-flash')
# And bam, you've got the Jumping Flash soundtrack!
```

## Usage
Just run `khinsider.py` from the command line with the sole parameter being the soundtrack you want to download. Easy!

If you want, you can also add another parameter as the output folder, but that's optional.

You're going to need [Python 2](https://www.python.org/downloads/), so install that (and [add it to your path](http://superuser.com/a/143121)) if you haven't already.

You will also need to have [pip](https://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html) installed (download `get-pip.py` and run it) if you don't already have [requests](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests) and [Beautiful Soup 4](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/beautifulsoup4). The first time `khinsider.py` runs, it will install these two for you.

Download for `khinsider.py` is on the right of this GitHub page - click "Download ZIP"!

## As a module
`khinsider.py` requires two non-standard modules: [requests](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests) and [beautifulsoup4](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/beautifulsoup4). Just run a `pip install` on them (with [pip](https://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html)), or just run `khinsider.py` on its own once and it'll install them for you.

Here are the functions you will be using:

###`khinsider.download(soundtrackName[, path="", verbose=False])`
Download the soundtrack `soundtrackName`. This should be the name the soundtrack uses at the end of its album URL.

If `path` is specified, the soundtrack files will be downloaded to that path. If `verbose` is `True`, it will print progress as it is downloading.

###`khinsider.search(term)`
Search khinsider for `term`. Return a list of soundtrack IDs matching the search term.
